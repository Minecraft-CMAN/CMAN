## About this

> WARNING: CMAN is a project in development, so if you run into any problems, please start an Issue with us.

CMAN stands for The Comprehensive Minecraft Archive Network. With the increasing complexity of Minecraft mod dependencies, we launched the CMAN project with reference to the experience of the game's Kerbal Space Program community in module management.

CMAN is dedicated to create a mod management mode different from the traditional "download mod manually => copy mod file game folder => check dependency => download dependency mod". To download mods with CMAN, you only need to check the mods you are interested in, click confirm, and CMAN will handle everything from mod download to dependency management.

## Getting Started

Work-in-progress.

## Upload your mod to CMAN

The CMAN-spider program will periodically get the latest mods from Modrinth for use in generating `.mod` files and uploading them to platforms like Github. All you need to do is upload your mods to Modrinth, and within 24 hours, you will be able to search for your mods on CMAN.

> If you do not want CMAN to include your mod, please add "[CMAN]Do not include this mod" to the mod's description.
